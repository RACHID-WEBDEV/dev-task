              <li>
                <b>Referral Program Overview</b> Our referral program allows
                users to earn referral bonuses and transfer rewards by inviting
                new customers to use our app. The referral costs and bonuses are
                as outlined on the referral page of the Mobile App. These
                bonuses and rewards are subject to the specific terms outlined
                in this policy and any additional terms published on the
                Platform. The value, method of distribution, and conditions for
                earning these rewards are determined solely at our discretion
                and may vary from time to time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Eligibility </b> Participation in the referral program is
                subject to the eligibility criteria set out by us. We reserve
                the right to verify participants and the validity of referred
                customers before issuing referral bonuses and transfer rewards.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Program Modifications</b> We reserve the right to modify,
                suspend, or terminate the referral program at any time, with or
                without prior notice. This includes the ability to change the
                value of referral bonuses and transfer rewards, adjust
                eligibility criteria, or cease offering rewards entirely.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Fraud and Abuse</b> Any attempt to manipulate, exploit, or
                abuse the referral program may result in disqualification from
                the program, forfeiture of rewards, and potential suspension or
                termination of your account.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>No Guarantee of Payment Referral </b> bonuses and transfer
                rewards are not guaranteed and are subject to verification by
                us. We may withhold or revoke rewards if we determine that they
                were earned in violation of these terms or through fraudulent or
                deceptive means.
              </li>
              <li>

                program, you agree to these terms and conditions, as well as any
                modifications or updates we may make. Continued participation
                after changes to the referral program constitutes acceptance of
                those changes.
